# wesh

`wesh` is a web shell for the [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/) personal server.

# Why?

The web-based tools that come with Umbrel are amazing but there will always be some case where you want to access the terminal, whether to investigate system performance using `top` or `iostat` or to run some of the many amazing command-line utilities useful for managing a LN node.
